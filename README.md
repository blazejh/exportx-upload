# ExportX Self-Hosted Uploader

This is a self-hosted, multi-platform image uploading service designed for the [ExportX Figma plugin](https://exportx.dev/).

By deploying this service yourself, you can securely upload your Figma assets directly to your own cloud storage (like Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3) without sharing any sensitive credentials with a third-party service.

## Deployment

Choose the platform that best suits your needs.

### 1. Cloudflare Workers (Recommended)

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Edward00Funny/exportx-upload)


This is the easiest and most cost-effective way to get started.

**Prerequisites:**
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and configured (`wrangler login`).
- An R2 bucket created.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/exportx-upload.git
    cd exportx-upload
    ```

2.  **Configure `wrangler.jsonc`:**
    - Rename `wrangler.jsonc.example` to `wrangler.jsonc` (if applicable).
    - Set your worker `name` and `account_id`.
    - Configure your R2 bucket binding:
      ```json
      [[r2_buckets]]
      binding = "R2_BUCKET"
      bucket_name = "your-r2-bucket-name"
      ```

3.  **Set environment variables:**
    Open `wrangler.jsonc` and add your secrets to the `[vars]` section.
    ```json
    [vars]
    AUTH_TOKEN = "your-secret-token-for-figma"
    STORAGE_PROVIDER = "R2"
    ```

4.  **Deploy:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    pnpm run deploy
    ```
    Wrangler will give you the URL of your deployed worker.

### 2. Docker (Google Cloud Run, DigitalOcean, etc.)

Use this method to deploy the service on any platform that supports Docker containers.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.

**Steps:**

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t exportx-uploader .
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**
    Provide all necessary environment variables using the `-e` flag.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
      -e PORT=3000 \
      -e AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token,another-token-for-teammate" \
      -e STORAGE_PROVIDER="S3" \
      -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key-id" \
      -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key" \
      -e AWS_S3_BUCKET="your-s3-bucket-name" \
      -e AWS_S3_REGION="your-s3-bucket-region" \
      --name exportx-uploader-instance \
      exportx-uploader
    ```
    Your service will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
